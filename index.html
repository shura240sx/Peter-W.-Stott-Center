   <h3>Who is Peter Stott?</h3>
     <p>The <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/buildings/campus-building/peter-stott-center" target="_blank">Peter Stott Center</a> is named for Peter W. Stott, "an alumnus and supporter of PSU, who founded Market Transport, Inc. in 1969 while attending Portland State" (<a href="https://www.pdx.edu/buildings/campus-building/peter-stott-center" target="_blank">PSU)</a>.</p>

   <h3>History of the Peter Stott Center</h3>
   <p>"The Peter Stott Center building was completed on October 15, 1966 and designed by the architects Wolff & Zimmer (now ZGF) for a total cost of $3.3 million and included a 1,700 seat gymnasium, a second smaller gym, weight training facilities, racquetball courts and a swimming pool. A rooftop running track and tennis courts, designed by Yost Grube Hall, were added in 1985. Stott Center was originally called the Physical Education (PE) and later the Health & Physical Education (HPE) building where it housed the department, and then School, of the same name. The School of Health & Physical Education (Health and Human Performance after 1990) was founded in 1948 during the Vanport-era where it was responsible for both physical education and athletics. Prior to the construction of the HPE Building, the Department held classes in the Lincoln Hall gym, the Synagogue Gym, the First Christian Church, and the Shattuck Pool, among other locations. The School of Health and Human Performance was closed in June of 1992 following a state-wide budget crisis precipitated by 1990's Oregon Ballot Measure 5. The HPE Building was renamed the Peter Stott Center in 1997 following a major renovation of the building in honor of Peter W. Stott who provided a $1 million challenge grant to help fund the project" (<a href="https://www.pdx.edu/buildings/campus-building/peter-stott-center" target="_blank">PSU)</a>.</p>
